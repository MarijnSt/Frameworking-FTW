### I used Bulma for this exercise

&nbsp;

#### Difficult things

* Vertically aligning things without any css was the most difficult part of this assignment
* I couldn't figure out how to add a shadow to the cards when you hover over them

&nbsp;

#### What was easy

* Sizing the columns and making rows was really easy
* Sizing images
* The is keyword makes the code a lot easier to understand
